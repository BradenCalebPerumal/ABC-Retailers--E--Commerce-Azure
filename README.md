ABC Retailers – Part 1 is an **ASP.NET Core MVC** web application designed to manage **customer sign-ups, product listings, and order processing** in a secure and scalable environment.  
The system uses **role-based authentication** for Admins and Customers, provides **product CRUD** operations, and stores data in **SQL Server** using Entity Framework Core.  
The UI is **handcrafted** (no Bootstrap) for a unique brand experience.
